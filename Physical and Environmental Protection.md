# Physical and Environmental Protection

THe primary consideration is the **site location**, as it will have an impact on both physical and environmental protections.

Cloud data centers share requirements with traditional colocation providers or individual data centers, including:

- ability to **restrict physical access** at multiple points
- ensuring a clean and stable **power supply**
- adequate **utilities** like water and sewer
- the availability of an adequate **workforce**

These are customer responsibilities in on-premises (private) cloud and CSP responsibility in the public cloud

# Site Selection and Facility Design

For site selection:

- Visibility, composition of the surrounding area, area accessibility, and the effects of natural disasters. (These are all problems for the CSP in the public cloud)

- Customers should focus on selecting CSP datacenter locations to meet disaster recovery and data residency(Remember CSPs auto-select region pairs for redundancy)
