## MultiVendor Pathway Connectivity

Connectivity to data center locations from more than one internet service provider (ISP) is multi-vendor pathway connectivity

Using multiple vendors is a proactive way for CSPs to mitigate the risk of losing network connectivity

Best practice for CSPs or Datacenters is dual-entry, dual-provider for high availability:

Two providers entering the building from separate locations

Cloud customers should consider multiple paths for communicating with their cloud vendor.
