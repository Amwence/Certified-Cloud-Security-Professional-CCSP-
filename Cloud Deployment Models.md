# Cloud Deployment Models

## Private Cloud

Uses a dedicated cloud infrastructure. Does not want to share computing resources with other organizations. Builds and runs its own cloud infrastructure or pays another organization to do so on its behalf. 

## Public Cloud

Organization uses the multitenancy infrastructure. In this approach cloud providers build massive infrastructures in their data centers and then make those resources available to all comers. The same physical hardware may be running workloads for many different customers at the same time. When organizations use public cloud resources, they must understand that security in the public cloud follows a shared responsibility model. Depending upon the nature of the cloud service, the cloud provider is responsible for some areas of secuirty while the customer is responsible for other areas. 

Depending on the nature of the cloud service, the cloud provider is responsible for some areas of security while the custoemr is responsible for other areas. 

For example, if you purchase cloud storage service, its your responsibility to know what data you're sending to that service and probably to configure access control policies that say who may access your data. It's the provider's responsibility to encrypt data under their care and correctly implement your access control policies. 

## Hybrid Cloud

Uses a combination of public and private cloud computing. May use the public cloud for some things, but also operate a private cloud for different workloads often because of data sensitivity concerns.  

## Multi-Cloud

Combines Resources from two different public cloud vendors. This approach allows organizations to take advantage of service and price differences, but comes at the cost of added complexity. 

## Community Cloud

Shared with a consortium. Similar to private clouds in that they are not shared with the general public, but are shared with several or many organizations. For example, a group of colleges might get together and create a community cloud that provides computing resources to all participating schools.
