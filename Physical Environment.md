# Physical Environment

There are infrastructure components that are common to all cloud service deliver models

- Most components are all physically located with the CSP, but many are accessible via the network

- The CSP takes on customer datacenter facilities, infrastructure management responsibilities

- In the shared responsibility model, some elements of operation are shared by the CSP and the customer. 

***NOTE: For the Exam remember who is responsible for what in the [Shared Responsibility model](Cloud%20Service%20Models.md)***

>CSP is responsible for all physcial aspects of their environment including data center **Facilities, Equipment, and Environment**

## Physical Environment Considerations

CSPs utilize common controls to address these risks

- For physical Security, standard measures such as locks, security personnel, lights, fences, visitor check-in procedures.

- Logical access controls, Identity and Access Management (IAM), single sign-on (SSO) provider, multifactor authentication (MFA) and logging. 

- Controls for data confidentiality and integrity like any cloud customer, but with much broader controls. 

***EXAMPLE: Ensuring that communication lines are not physically compromised by locating telecommunications equipment inside a controlled area of the CSPs building or campus***
