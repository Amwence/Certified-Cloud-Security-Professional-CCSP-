# Physical Design

## Build Vs. Buy

Build:

- Requires significant investment to build a robust data center

- Offers the most control over Data center Design

- Requires knowledge and skill to match quality of BUY option

BUY:

- Generally, lower cost of entry (especially in a shared scenario)

- Less flexibility in service design (limited to what provder offers)

- Shared datacenters come with additional security challenges

(CSPs offer many advantages of "build" at  "buy" price tag)

## Physical Design - Considerations

- Location of the data center
- Availability of affordable, stable, resilient electricity
- Natural disaster exposure (flood, hurricane, tornado,earthquake, etc.)
- Availability of high-speed redundant internet connectivity
- Availability of other utilities
- Physical site security (Vehicular approaches, visibility)
- Interior access controls (badges, key codes, secured doors)
- Fire detection and prevention systems
- Protection of sensitive assets, systems, wiring closets, etc. 
> Due to it's cloud focus, the CSP exam spends little time on physical security, focusing more on aspects of logical security and design.

## Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning

An HVAC failure can reduce availability of computing resources, just like a power failure

Customer reviews of CSP should include the adequacy and redundancy of HVAC systems

A number of documents can help assess HVAC concerns, such as a SOC-2 Type II report. 

Because of the confidential info in a SOC 2 Type II, some CSPs will require a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) prior to sharing. 

> A routine review of the most current SOC 2 report is critical part of a cloud customer's due diligence in CSP evaluations.
