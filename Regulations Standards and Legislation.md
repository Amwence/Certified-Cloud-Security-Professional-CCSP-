# Regulations Standards and Legislation

## ISO/IEC 27017:2015

Provides guidelines for information security controls applicable to the provision and use of cloud services. 

Provides cloud-based guidance on several ISO/IEC 27002 controls, along with seven cloud controls that address: 

    1. Who is responsible for what between the cloud service provider and the cloud customer
    2. The removal/return of assets when a contract is terminated
    3. Protection and separation of the customer's virtual environment
    4. Virtual Machine Configuration
    5. Administrative operations and procedures associated with the cloud environment
    6. Customer monitoring of activity within the cloud
    7. Virtual and cloud network environment alignment

## PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)

A widely accepted set of policies and procedures intended to optimize the security of credit, debit, and cash card transactions.

Created jointly in 2004 by four major credit card companies: Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express.

***Based on 6 major objectives:***

1. A secure network must be maintained in which transactions can be conducted
2. cardholder information must be protected wherever it is stored
3. Systems should be protected against the activities of malicious hackers
4. Cardholder data should be protected physically as well as electronically
5. Networks must be constantly monitored and regularly tested
6. A formal information security policy must be defined, maintained, and followed

## Common Criteria (ISO/IEC15408)

Enable an objective evaluation to validate that a particular product or system satisfies a defined set of security requirements

Ensures customers that security products they purchase have been thoroughly tested by independent third-party testers

... and meets customer requirements. 

The certification of the product only certifies product capabilities

***NOTE: Designed to provide assurances for security claims by vendors***

> If Misconfigured or mismanaged, software is no more secure than anything else the customer might use. 

## FIPS 140-2 (Federal Information Processing Standard)

Established to aid in the protection of digitally stored unclassified, yet sensitive, information

Developed by NIST, for use in computer systems by non-military American government agencies and government contractors

***FIPS Security Levels***

1. Lowest Level of Security
2. Specifies the security requirements for cryptographic modules that protect sensitive information.
3. Requires physical protections to ensure a high degree of confidence that any attempts to tamper are evident and detectable.
