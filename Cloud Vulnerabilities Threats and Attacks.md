# Cloud Vulnerabilities, Threats and Attacks

The primary vulnerability in the cloud is that it is an internet-based model

Organizations could be at risk if the CSP's public-facing infrastructure comes under attack

Any attack on your CSP or cloud vendor may be unrelated to you as an organization

Threat actors may be targeting the CSP or another tenant of the CSP

Risks can come from other tenants as well. 
(Customers may be "collateral damage" of an attack on the CSP)
