# Account Types

## Service Account (Service Principal)

When software is installed on a computer or server, it may require privleged access to run. 

a lower-level administrative account, and the service account fits the bill

> A service account is a type of administrator account used to run an application. (E.G account to run an anti-virus application)

## Shared Account

When a group of people ***performs the same duties***, such as members of customer service, they can use a shared account. 

When *** user-level monitoring, auditing, or non-repudiation*** are required, you must eliminate the use of shared accounts. 

***NOTE: Most cloud Identity providers have options to eliminate the need for shared accounts***

# Privileged Access Management

A solution that helps protect the ***privileged accounts within a tenant***, preventing attacks

***NOTE: Also provides visibility into who is using privileged accounts and what tasks they are being used for.***

***Native to some cloud identity providers today, and may include a just-in-time elevation feature (privilege increased to complete a task or alloted time period, then removed after task is completed or time has lapsed)***
