# Zero Trust Security

Addresses the limitations of the legacy network perimeter-based security model.

Treats user ***identity*** as the ***control plane***.

Assumes compromise/breach in verifying every request

> NO ENTITY IS TRUSTED BY DEFUALT!!!!

# Zero Trust Principles

- ***Verify Explicitly***. **Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points**, including user identity, location, device health, service or workload, data classification, and anomalies.

- ***Use Least Privilege Access***. Limit user access with just-in-time and just-enough-access (JIT and JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection.

- ***Assume Breach***. **Segment access to minimize scope of impact.*** Verify end-to-end encryption use, analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses.
