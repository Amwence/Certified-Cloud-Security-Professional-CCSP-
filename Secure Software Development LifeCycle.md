# Secure Software Development Lifecycle

## Business Requirements

Mature software development shops utilize an SDLC because it saves money and supports repeatable, quality software development.

SSDLC is fully successful only if the integration of security into an organization's existing SDLC is required for all development efforts. 

**Business Requirments** capture what the organization needs its information systems to do. 

**Functional Requirements** detail what the solution must do, such as supporting up as max concurrent user requirements...

...which in turn support business requirements, like all workers being able to access a system to perform their assigned duties. 

> In addition to these functional requirements, the organization must also consider **security, privacy, and compliance** objectives.

# SSDLC

1. Planning
    - considers potential development work, focusing on determining need, feasibility, and cost. 
2. Requirements
    - Once an effort has been deemed feasible user and business functionality requirements are captured. 
    - Involves user, customer and stakeholder input to determine desired functionality, current system or app functionality, and desired improvements. 
3. Design
    - Design functionality, architecture, integration points and techniques, data flows, and business processes.
4. Coding
    - Where coding (work) happens
5. Testing
6. Maintenance
