# Baselines Configurations and Change

## Configuration & Change Management

- ***Configuration Managmenet*** - ensures that systems are configured similarly, **configurations are known and documented**.

- ***Baselining*** - ensures that systems are deployed with a common baseline or starting point, and imaging is a common baselining method. 

- ***Change Management*** - Helps reduce outages or weakened security from **unauthorized changes** to the baseline configuration

- ***Versioning*** - Uses a labeling or numbering system to track changes in updated versions of baseline (images, application, system, etc.) 

> Requires changes to be requested, approved, tested, and documented

## Patch management (Update Management)

The process of identifying, acquiring, installing, and verifying patches for products and systems. 

It is a function included in change management

**Patches** correct security and functionality problems in software and firmware

***NOTE: Both applicability and install are automated with management tools***

> An **Applicability Assessment*** is performed to determin whether a particular patch or update applies to a system
