# Cloud Shared Considerations

All cloud customers and CSPs share a set of concerns or considerations. It is no longer the case that all companies use a single CSP or SaaS vendor. In fact, Larger companies may use multiple vendors and two or more CSPs in their delivery services. The business choice is to use the best service for a particular use (best being defined by the customer based on features, cost, or availability).

## Interoperability

With the concern over vendor lock-in, interoperability is a primary consideration. Interoperability creates the ability to communicate with and share data across multiple platforms and between traditional and cloud services provided by different vendors. Avoiding vendor lock-in allows the customer to make decisions based on the cost, feature set, or availability of a particular service regardless of the vendor providng the service. Interoperability leads to a richer set of alternatives and more choices in pricing. 

## Portability

Portability may refer to data portability or achitecture portability. Data portability is focused on the ability to move data between traditional  and cloud services or between different cloud services without having to port the data under challenging and lossy methods or significant changes to either service or the loss of metadata. 

Data portability matters to an organization that uses a multicloud approach, as data moves between vendors. Each move cannot create a data porting exercise, or it is not seamless or useful. It is also important in a loud bursting scenario, where peak usage expands into a cloud environment and then shrinks back to its original noncloud size. This myust be seamless to make the strategy useful. Data backupos are increasingly to the cloud, and a restore to in-house servers must be handled easily. 

Architecture portability is concerned with the ability to access and run a cloud service from a wide variety of devices, running different operating systems. This allows users on a Windows laptop and a MacBook Pro to use the same application services, share the same data, and collaborate easilly. 

## Reversability

Reversability is a measure of the extent your cloud services can be moved from one cloud environment to another. This includes moving between a cloud environment and an on-premise traditional environment. The movement between environments must be simple and automatic. Companies now move to and from the cloud and between clouds in a multicloud environment and when cloud bursting. 

## Availability

Availability has two components. The first is one leg of the CIA triad. Within the constraints of the agreed-upon SLA (Service Level Agreement), the purchased services and company or individual data must be made available to the customer by the CSP. If the SLA is not met, the contract will spell out the penalties or recourses available.

## Security

Cloud security is a challenging endeavor. It is true that the larger CSPs spend resou rces and focus on creating a secure environment. It is equally true that a large CSP is a large target, and there are aspects of cloud computing, such as multitenancy, that create anew complexities to security.

One issue that is part of various national laws such as the GDPR restriction on cross-border transfers of data. In an environment where the actual hardware coudl be anywhere, it is an important consideration to know where your data resides. 

***The owner of data remains ultimately responsible for the security of the data, regardless of what cloud or noncloud services are used. Cloud security involves more than protection of the data but includes the applications and infrastructure.***

## Privacy

The involvement of third-party providers, in an off-premises situation, creates challenges to data protection and privacy. The end user cannot always determine what controls are in place to protect their privacy of their data and must rely on privacy practice documents and other reports to determine if they trust the third-party to protect their data privacy. 

***Privacy concerns include access to data both during a contract and at the end of a contract as well as the erasure or destruction of data when requested or as required within the contract. Regulatory and contractual requirements such as HIPAA and PCI are also key concerns. Monitoring and logging of data access and modification, and the location of data storage, are additional privacy concerns.***

## Resiliency

Resilience is the ability to continue operating under adverse or unexpected conditions. This involves both business continuity and disaster recovery planning and implementation. Business continuity might dictate that a customer stores their data in multiple regions so that a service interruption in one region does not prevent continued operations. 

## Performance

Performance is measured through an SLA. Performance of a cloud service is generally quite high as major CSPs build redundancy into their systems. The major performance concerns are network avaialability and bandwidth. A network is a hard requirement of a cloud service, and if the network is down, the service is unavailable. In addition, if you are in an area of limited bandwidth, performance will be impacted. 

## Governance

Cloud governance uses the same mechanismse as gvernance of your on premises IT solutions. THis includes policies, procedures, and controls. Controls include encryption, access control lists (ACLs), and identity and access management. As many organizations have cloud services from multiple vendors, a cloud governance framework and application can make the maintenance and automation of cloud governance manageable. This may be another cloud solution. 

A variety of governance solutions, some cloud based, exist to support this need. Without governance, cloud solutions can easily grow beyond what can be easily managed. For example, a company may want to govern the number of CSP accounts, the number of server instances, the amount of storage utilized, the size of databases, and other storage tools. Each of these add to the cost of cloud computing. A tool that tracks usage and associated costs will help an organization use the cloud efficiently and keep its use under budget.
