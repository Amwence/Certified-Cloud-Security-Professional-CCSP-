# Cloud Shared Considerations

All cloud customers and CSPs share a set of concerns or considerations. It is no longer the case that all companies use a single CSP or SaaS vendor. In fact, Larger companies may use multiple vendors and two or more CSPs in their delivery services. The business choice is to use the best service for a particular use (best being defined by the customer based on features, cost, or availability).

## Interoperability

With the concern over vendor lock-in, interoperability is a primary consideration. Interoperability creates the ability to communicate with and share data across multiple platforms and between traditional and cloud services provided by different vendors. Avoiding vendor lock-in allows the customer to make decisions based on the cost, feature set, or availability of a particular service regardless of the vendor providng the service. Interoperability leads to a richer set of alternatives and more choices in pricing.
