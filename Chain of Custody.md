# Chain of Custody

Tracks the movement of evidence through its collection, safeguarding, and analysis lifecycle

## Functions and Importance of Chain of Custody

Provides evidence integrity through convincing proof evidence was not tampered with in a way that damages its reliablity.

**Documents key elements of evidence movement and handling, including:**

- Each person who handled the evidence
- Date and Time of Movement/Transfer
- Purpose of Evidence Movement/Transfer

**What if evidence is left unattended or handled by unauthorized parties?**

Then, criminal defendants can claim the data was altered in a way that incriminates them, and thus the evidence is no longer reliable. 

> Foundational principle of evidence handling in legal preceedings!

# Non-Repudiation
 
 Non-repudiation is the guarantee that no one can deny a transaction

 ## Methods to provide non-repudiation

 Systems enforce nonrepudiation through the inclusion of sufficient evidence in **log files**, including unique user identification and timestamps.

 ## Digital Signatures

 Prove that a digital message or document was not modified - intentially or unintentionally - from the time it was signed.

 Based on asymmetric cryptography (a public/private key pair)
 it's the digital equivalent of a handwritten signature or stamped seal.

 > Multiple accounts make non-repudiation more difficult (user logging in with multiple identities makes it harder to track their movements and activities)
 > **Shared Accounts make non-repudiation virtually impossible!** (No longer able to tie individual actions to individual people)
