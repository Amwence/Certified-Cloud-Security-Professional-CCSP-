# Limiting Access and Damage

> ***Need to know*** and the ***principle of least privilege*** are two standard IT security principles implemented in secure networks. 

- They limit access to data and systems so that users and other subjects have access only to what they require

- They help prevent security incidents

- They help limit the scope of incidents when they occur. 

***NOTE: When these principles are not followed, security incidents **result in far greater damage** to an organization***

# Preventing Fraud and Collusion

> **Collusion** is an agreement among multiple persons to perform some unauthorized or illegal actions.

## Separation of Duties

- A basic security principle that ensures that no single person can control all the elements of a critical function or system.

## Job rotation

- Employees are rotated into different jobs, or tasks are assigned to different employees.

***NOTE: Implementing these Policies **Helps Prevent Fraud** by limiting actions individuals can do without colluding with others***
