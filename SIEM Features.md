# SIEM Features

Key SIEM features necessary to optimize event detection and visibility and scale security operations

## Log Centralization and Aggregation

Rather than leaving log data scattered around the environment on various hosts, the SIEM platform can gather logs from a variety of sources, including:

- Operating Systems
- Applications
- Network Appliances
- User Devices
- Provides a single location to support investigations

## Data Integrity

The SIEM should be on a separate host with it's own access control, preventing any single user from tampering
