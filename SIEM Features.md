# SIEM Features

Key SIEM features necessary to optimize event detection and visibility and scale security operations

## Log Centralization and Aggregation

Rather than leaving log data scattered around the environment on various hosts, the SIEM platform can gather logs from a variety of sources, including:

- Operating Systems
- Applications
- Network Appliances
- User Devices
- Provides a single location to support investigations

## Data Integrity

The SIEM should be on a separate host with it's own access control, preventing any single user from tampering

## Normalization

SIEMS can normalize incoming data to ensure that the data from a variety of sources is presented consistently

## Automated or Continuous Monitoring

Sometimes reffered to as Correlation, SIEMS use algorithms to evaluate data and identify potential attacks or compromises.

## Alerting

SIEMS can automatically generate alerts such as emails or tickets when action is required based on analysis of incoming log data

## Investigative Monitoring

When manual investigation is required, the SIEM should provide support capabilities such as querying log files, generating reports, etc.
