# Data Dispersion

A core principle of business continuity says that important data should always be stored in more than one location. 

Data dispersion is easier in the cloud because the CSP owns the underlying complexity that delivers site-level resiliency.

Cloud storage for IaaS includes different levels of storage for redundancy, including:

> ***Local** - replicas within a single datacenter
> *** Zone*** - replicas in multiple data centers within a region
> ***Global*** - region level resiliency (replicas to backup region)
