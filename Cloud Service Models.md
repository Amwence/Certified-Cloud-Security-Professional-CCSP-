# Cloud Service Models

There are 3 types of service models:

## Software as a Service (SaaS)

The least control for end user, with only basic configuration controls available if any.

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

While PaaS may be intended for use by developers, there may be some administration of the service by the company as well. In fact, the lines often blur when a corporation enters into a business relationship with a cloud provider but does much of the provisioning and administrative work in house. 

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Has the most control for the end user, where operating system selection, configuration, patching, software tools and applications are all controlled by the end user.
