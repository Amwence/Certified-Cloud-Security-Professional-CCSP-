# Cloud Service Models

There are 3 types of service models:

## Software as a Service (SaaS)

The least control for end user, with only basic configuration controls available if any.

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

While PaaS may be intended for use by developers, there may be some administration of the service by the company as well. In fact, the lines often blur when a corporation enters into a business relationship with a cloud provider but does much of the provisioning and administrative work in house. 

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Has the most control for the end user, where operating system selection, configuration, patching, software tools and applications are all controlled by the end user. 

# Cloud Service Capabilities

Capability types are another way to look at cloud service models. In this view, we look at the capapbilities provided by each model. Our three service models are SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. Each provides a different level and type of service to the customer. The shared security responsibility differ for each type as well. 

## Application Capability Types

Application capabilities include the ability to access an application over the network from multiple devices and from multiple locations. Application access may be made through a web interface, through a thin client, or in some other manner. As the application and data are stored in the cloud, the same data is available to a user from whichever device they connect from. Depending on the end user, the look of the interface may be different.
