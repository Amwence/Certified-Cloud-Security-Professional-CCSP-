# Risk Mitigation Strategies

These are several approaches to risk mitigation in cloud environments

Selecting a qualified CSP is an essential first step.
The next step is designing and architecting with security in mind. (Security should be considered at every step starting with design)

The next risk mitigation tool is encryption, and data should be encrypted at rest and in-transit.(Storage and data base encryption at rest, TLS and VPN in-transit)

Finally, ongoing monitoring and management to maintain posture.(Major CSPs provide the ability to manage and monitor configuration security, and to monitor changes to cloud services, and track usage)
