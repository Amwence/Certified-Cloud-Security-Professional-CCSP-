# Design Resiliency

Resilient designs are engineered to respond positively to changes or disturbances, such as natural disasters or man-made disturbances. 

Examples:

- High Availability (HA) firewalls, active-passive or active-active

- Multi-Vendor pathway connectivity

- Web server far (behind redundant load balancers)

- Database cluster (Windows/Linux cluster feature)
